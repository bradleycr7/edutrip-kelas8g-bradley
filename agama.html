            <figcaption><strong>The Holy Catholic Family Church</strong> has many differences compared to the church in the students' school, <strong>Santa Laurensia</strong>. The church in Taiwan sang a little bit only, has no illustration of the twelve disciples of Jesus, and also offers mass in multiple languages. Meanwhile, the <Strong>church of Saint Lawrence</Strong> has statues of the twelve disciples of Jesus and has a lot more singing. Overall, the experience on going on the English mass in the <strong>Holy Catholic Family Church</strong> was phenomenal.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>In here, the students did some <strong>community service</strong> with old people, where they played games with them, talked with them, and also a whole lot more activities. From this experience, the students achieved their goal to entertain and make the elders happy, which in a way follows what Jesus did by comforting other people.</figcaption>
