      </figure>
      <p><strong>Taipei 101</strong> is the first ever tower to exceed 500 meters tall. It is also the <strong>tallest building in Taiwan, located in Taipei.</strong> This skyscraper was finished being built in the year 2004 after a whole 5 years, after the construction started in 1999. An attraction as amazing as this, where the tower stretches beyond the clouds, is a must-try experience, which is why tourists visit Taipei 101 all the time. The reason its name is Taipei 101 is to represent the 101 floors of the building, and also the name of the city it was made in: Taipei. In addition, this skyscraper is the tallest tower in an area where earthquakes often happen, and it can withstand strong earthquakes due to its <strong>660-ton tuned mass damper</strong> in the building.</p>
      <p>Even before the view, Taipei 101 gives you a taste of the extraordinary with their high-speed elevator. The elevator speeds from the <strong>5th floor to the 89th floor in just 37 seconds</strong>. Despite the incredible speed, you’ll feel no shaking nor noise, making it very calming throughout the short ride. It feels very surreal being almost 400 meters higher in the building <strong>in the matter of just 37 seconds</strong>. From the ground to the clouds, you get to experience both in a span of less than a minute. Even in the calm journey, your ears will tell you that you’re way high up by popping themselves.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>An incredible view awaits at the <strong>Observatory Deck</strong>>, where it shows just how big and beautiful Taipei really is. Once the elevator ride is over, the real deal starts as you enter the <strong>Observatory Deck</strong>. You take your first step and walk into another world, seeing the city of Taipei in a whole other perspective. Buildings that looked so huge from the ground now look like tiny blocks as you observe from above. Each angle of the view has their own unique sights that together complete <strong>the city of Taipei</strong>, giving you a taste of the city from all perspectives. It almost feels dreamy from the shift in atmospheres between the busy and noisy streets to the calm and quiet setting at the top of the tower.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Meeting the <strong>Tuned Mass Damper</strong> is really interesting, especially after you learn more about it. The <strong>Tuned Mass Damper</strong> is a very big golden sphere that weights 660 ton, located in the 88th floor. Your mind will be blown once you learn that they had to move it one floor upwards using pistons each time a floor was finished being built during construction. In addition, there are also Damper babies which serves as a mascot to make the vibe more lively. It is definitely a must to check out the golden giant when you visit Taipei 101.</p>
      <p>Visiting Taipei 101 was more than just seeing a tall building, but also experiencing and taking a look at the technology and engineering there. Taipei 101 has <strong>very advanced technology and engineering</strong>, added with the beautiful view of the city from above the sky. But Taipei 101’s view isn’t its only specialty when there are other wonders like the <strong>high-speed elevator and the Tuned Mass Damper</strong>. The journey from the elevator ride, to the breathtaking view, and finishing it off with the sight of the golden heart, it was all amazing. Also, you definitely do not want to forget to take pictures to remind you about the memory of once experiencing all these wonders here at Taipei 101. At the end of the adventure, you’ll step out with new eyes and a newfound perspective of this lovely city, Taipei.</p>
